# Audio Hash (Web)

A web app that allows you to load multiple audio files and mix them together into one file (a "hash").

The original idea was to automate making "samplers" of tracks from an album of music by grabbing random bits of a few songs and combining them into one with some cross-fades and such.

## Current capabilities

* audio format: WAV
* audio file amount: whole file
* audio file mixing: none
* play audio hash
* download audio hash

## Future capabilities

* audio formats: AIFF, MP3, M4A, FLAC(?)
* audio file amounts: whole file, random snippet in seconds
* audio file mixing: crossfade
